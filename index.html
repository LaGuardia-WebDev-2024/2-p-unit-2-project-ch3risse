      always consider what feeling you want to induce with the clothing
      <i>first.</i> it really helps you stay in the the lane of outfit-building.
      without the color scheme or"feeling" first, you're putting an outfit
      together blindly. we can't have that! <br />

<br>      really gives you the vibe of a tuscan heaven, right? i know. the thing to focus on is the <i>brown.</i> brown, with this  texture, is smooth and not too overstimulating.
      
      <h2>
        Well, what now?
      </h2>
 well! now you can focus on structure. an example could be skinny pants with a bigger shirt, and vice versa. don't put skinny, yuck. baggy and baggy pants work, but you have to know the sillouette.
         <p id= "poop">You have to know the sillouhette before you continue with any other step. don't skip it! You'll either overclutter, or not have on something that flatters you.</p>

      <p id= "clothing"> These dapper people have <i>clear sillouhettes.</i> Snug on wide legged, and vice versa. If you really want to push your sillouhette, try wearing a big jacket with exaggerative accessories. It'll really bring thiungs together in photos, and make you stand out! Note: also try going for face accessories. Don't be afraid of trying new glasses, dramatic makeup, vibrant lips, or even a piercing! Wear whatever you want!<br>

           <p class= "clothing"> In the end, you can wear whatever you want. I can't tell you what to do! so, take my advice, or don't. I would support your ideas either way. Anyway, happy styling!
